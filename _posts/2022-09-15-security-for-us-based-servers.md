This is a quick reminder, that the FBI and government will most definitely get warrants and get into the servers if they know a user that they're looking for or want to search has an account on your server. [The Gaurdian News](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email) with info about it.

Thats something to think about if you want to respect peoples privacy. Main thing to keep in mind is to have the servers it in Switzerland, but even then they could still get to the servers.
